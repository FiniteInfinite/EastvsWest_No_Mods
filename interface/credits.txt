§SPECIAL NOTES
Between the 30th of August and the 2nd of September 2013, 
Gabor Gombor and Jorge Martins did the impossible. 
A computer program will always do what you tell it to do, 
but rarely what you want to do so therfore the guys pulled 16 hours shifts. 
Soon they proved that when the going gets tough, upgrade! Fantastic
