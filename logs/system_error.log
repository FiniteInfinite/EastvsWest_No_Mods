[internationalizedtext.cpp:792]: TEXT ERROR: The tag for $5 billion per month. Syria's closure of the Kirkuk-Banis pipeline left Iraq with the pipeline to Turkey as the only mean of exporting oil. However, that pipeline had a capacity of only 500,000 barrels per day (79,000 m3/d), which was insufficient to pay for the war. It appeared that Iraq’s war would be bled dry before it had begun.  
[internationalizedtext.cpp:792]: TEXT ERROR: The tag for $60 billion in subsidies per year. These nations greatly feared an Iranian victory especially after the Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini declared monarchies to be illegitimate and an un-Islamic form of government. Thanks to this financial aid Iraq could continue its war against Iran despite the Syrian Oil pipeline trade closure.
